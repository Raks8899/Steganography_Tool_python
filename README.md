- Advanced Steganography Tool

  
This Python project implements a graphical Steganography Tool using Tkinter for the GUI and OpenCV/PIL for image processing. The application allows users to embed secret text messages inside image pixels and retrieve them later using a passcode.

üìë Code Structure and Explanation
1Ô∏è‚É£ Imports & Setup
python
Copy
Edit
import cv2
import os
import tkinter as tk
from tkinter import filedialog, messagebox, ttk
from tkinter import Label, Entry, Button, Text, Frame
from PIL import Image, ImageTk
cv2 (OpenCV): Handles image reading, manipulation, and saving.
tkinter: Used for creating the GUI (buttons, labels, file dialogs, etc.).
PIL (Pillow): Used to resize and display images inside the GUI.
2Ô∏è‚É£ Character Dictionaries
python
Copy
Edit
d, c = {}, {}
for i in range(255):
    d[chr(i)] = i

d maps characters to their ASCII values.
c maps ASCII values back to characters.
These mappings are used to embed and extract message characters in/from image pixels.

1Ô∏è‚É£1Ô∏è‚É£ Theme Toggle Function
python

Edit
def toggle_theme():
    ...
Switches between a dark hacker-style theme and a light theme.
Updates background, text colors, and widget appearances dynamically.
1Ô∏è‚É£2Ô∏è‚É£ GUI Setup (Main Window)
python
Copy
Edit
root = tk.Tk()
root.title("Steganography Tool - Advanced")
...
Sets up the main window title, size, and background color.
Defines all labels, buttons, entries, text areas, and progress bar.
Buttons are linked to their respective functions (encrypt, decrypt, load image, etc.).
1Ô∏è‚É£3Ô∏è‚É£ Image Display Area
python
Copy
Edit
img_label = Label(root, ...)
...
This is a Label widget where the selected image is displayed after resizing.
1Ô∏è‚É£4Ô∏è‚É£ Message and Passcode Inputs
python
Copy
Edit
msg_entry = Entry(root, ...)
pass_entry = Entry(root, ...)
decrypt_pass_entry = Entry(root, ...)
Text entry widgets where users type:
Secret message to hide.
Passcode to protect the message.
Passcode to unlock the message.
1Ô∏è‚É£5Ô∏è‚É£ Log Console
python
Copy
Edit
log_console = Text(root, ...)
Text area where all logs (success/error/info) are shown to the user in real-time.
1Ô∏è‚É£6Ô∏è‚É£ Progress Bar
python
Copy
Edit
progress_bar = ttk.Progressbar(root, ...)
Displays progress animation during encryption/decryption to indicate processing.
1Ô∏è‚É£7Ô∏è‚É£ Main Loop
python
Copy
Edit
root.mainloop()
Starts the Tkinter event loop, keeping the window open and interactive.
üß© Data Encoding Process Summary
Encoding (Encryption)
Each character's ASCII value is stored in a single color channel (R, G, B) of each pixel.
Example:
First pixel's red channel gets the first character.
First pixel's green channel gets the second character.
First pixel's blue channel gets the third character.
Continues pixel by pixel until the whole message is encoded.
Decoding (Decryption)
The reverse of the encoding process.
Reads characters back from each pixel‚Äôs R, G, B channels.
Combines all characters into the full message.
üïµÔ∏è Security Note
The passcode check is only applied before decryption, but it does not encrypt the image itself.
To make it more secure, you could consider adding encryption to the message itself before hiding it in the image.

üìÑ Code Description - Advanced Steganography Tool
üìå Overview
This Python-based Steganography Tool allows users to hide secret messages inside images and later retrieve them using a passcode. The tool provides a graphical user interface (GUI) built with Tkinter and utilizes OpenCV/PIL for image processing.

üìë Code Structure & Explanation
1Ô∏è‚É£ Imports & Setup
The code imports essential libraries:

cv2 (OpenCV) - Image processing.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Character Dictionaries for Encoding
python
Copy
Edit
d, c = {}, {}
for i in range(255):
    d[chr(i)] = i
    c[i] = chr(i)
These dictionaries convert characters to ASCII values and back. They are used when hiding and extracting messages.
